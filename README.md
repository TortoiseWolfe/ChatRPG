"Welcome, players, to our new adventure set in the Star Wars universe, five years before the Battle of Yavin. Each of you, with your unique backgrounds and motivations, has found yourselves in Imperial custody for various reasons. You've been detained aboard an Imperial prison transport ship, "The Azure Marauder," captained by the experienced and enigmatic Lira Kelloran. Your destination: "The Iron Star," a maximum-security prison facility located on an isolated moon in the Outer Rim.

As your characters interact with one another and the other prisoners on board, it becomes clear that there's more to this situation than meets the eye. You'll encounter a secretive and heavily guarded prisoner named Calen Ordo, a former Imperial engineer, whose presence on the ship has drawn the attention of both the Empire and the early Rebellion.

Your primary objective at the beginning of the campaign is to devise and execute an escape plan from "The Azure Marauder" before it reaches "The Iron Star." In doing so, you'll need to collaborate with your fellow prisoners, gather information, and secure resources to ensure a successful escape.

As the story unfolds, you'll uncover hidden secrets, face moral dilemmas, and make choices that will shape not only your characters' destinies but also the fate of the galaxy. Your actions and decisions will determine the course of the adventure, leading you down paths unknown and filled with danger and intrigue.

So, let's get started, and may the Force be with you!"
